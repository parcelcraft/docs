# Strategies to find the best shipping rates

When you sign up for an EasyPost account, you're automatically enrolled with discounted shipping rates with some types of carriers. There's nothing you need to do to apply and qualify for these discounted rates. These rates are built-in and automatic, but only with certain carriers and shipment types. EasyPost may have more information regarding their rates.  They do not have discounted rates with all carriers, but a list of their compatible carriers with their discounts can be found here:

Our advertised discounted shipping rates are EasyPost's discounted shipping rates.

However, if you have negotiated rates with, say, UPS, FedEx, or DHL, you can add your own carrier account at https://app.easypost.com/account/settings?tab=carriers

On EasyPost's carrier management page, there are two sections:

1. **EasyPost Carrier accounts**: These use EasyPost's discounted shipping rates. Shipping costs are billed to you through EasyPost.
2. **My Carrier Accounts**: These use your own negotiated rates through your carrier. You can add your own carrier by clicking "Add carrier". Shipments created using these accounts are billed to your specific carrier, say UPS for example.

After you add your carrier in EasyPost, refresh the ParcelCraft Shipping App to see your updated carrier options.

## Here's some tips to get the best rates when you create a shipment:

In Parcelcraft Shipping app you can create a label to see price quotes from among all your carriers.  The quote will return a list of rates compatible with your shipment.  Some carriers require certain packing types to return a compatible rate.  For example, to get access to the  First Class Letter rate, you would need to select USPS as your carrier, select "Letter" as your packaing type, and limit your weight to 3.5 ounces to see that rate quote:

You can see the $0.69 rate for First Class is better than the public rate of $0.73.

When you request a quote for your shipment, the app will return only rates compatible with the shipping information (weight, packaging type and carrier) you provide.  

In your workflow, when you create a shipment, you may want to get a quote from among all your carriers first, and then when you've narrowed down your best selection for a carrier, re-quote the shipment with the specific carrier, with any specialized packaging, for example, sending a UPS letter overnight is much cheaper than sending a package with specified dimensions of the same size.

When you request a quote from "All carriers", we strip away your packaging type and carrier to be compatible with the request to quote from all your carriers. Always request a quote from your specific carrier to see the best shipping rates for your specific carrier and packaging type.
