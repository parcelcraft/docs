## Adding Your Own Carrier Accounts

If you have negotiated rates with carriers like UPS, FedEx, or DHL, add your carrier accounts at: https://app.easypost.com/account/settings?tab=carriers

The carrier management page has two sections:

After adding carriers in EasyPost, refresh the ParcelCraft Shipping App to see your updated carrier options.

## Getting the Best Rates

Create labels in the ParcelCraft Shipping app to compare price quotes across all carriers. The system returns only rates compatible with your shipment specifications.

**Example**: For USPS First Class Letter rates, select:
- Carrier: USPS
- Packaging: Letter  
- Weight: Under 3.5 ounces

You can see the $0.69 rate for First Class is better than the public rate of $0.73.

When you request a quote for your shipment, the app will return only rates compatible with the shipping information (weight, packaging type and carrier) you provide.  

In your workflow, when you create a shipment, you may want to get a quote from among all your carriers first, and then when you've narrowed down your best selection for a carrier, re-quote the shipment with the specific carrier, with any specialized packaging, for example, sending a letter in UPS letter packaging for overnight shipments is significantly cheaper than sending a package with specified dimensions of the same size.

When quoting "All carriers," the system removes packaging type and carrier specifications for compatibility. Always request carrier-specific quotes to see the best rates for your exact requirements.
