# Automatically Print Label Attachments Sent to Your Email Address

Parcelcraft can send label and form files to an email address. With proper setup, you shouldn't need to select your print options every time you ship: your printer will automatically start printing after you click **1-click ship**.

> Note: Printing to email is not our recommendation. Instead, use the [PrintNode](enable-1-click-shipping/setup-printnode-account) option for easier setup. PrintNode allows up to 50 free prints per month and offers reasonable prices for additional quantities. 

## Tools to Automatically Print Email Attachments

There are several tools that can help you automatically print attachments arriving at your email address:

- If you use Outlook, refer to [How to Print Incoming Mail Automatically in Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/automatically-print-incoming-mail-outlook-1173140).

- If you have an HP Printer, use [HPSmart](https://www.hpsmart.com/). See [How do I ePrint?](https://www.hpsmart.com/us/en/cms/HPC/ePrint)

- Use Automatic Email Manager 6. See [Automatically Print Your Emails with Attachments](https://www.automatic-email-manager.com/feature-print-email-body-and-attachments).

Both labels and forms are sent to the same email address. If you use one printer for labels and another for customs forms, you can create rules in your email client to forward emails to the correct address based on the subject line of the email you receive from Parcelcraft.

After setting up your printer to receive email attachments, test printing both a label and a form from the Parcelcraft printer settings page.

> Note: When you create return labels, you'll have the option to email labels directly to your customers. The settings here do not apply to customer return label emails.
