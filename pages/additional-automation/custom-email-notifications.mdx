# Custom Email Notifications

You can let Parcelcraft send your customers a generic email with tracking information or use your own SendGrid account to customize your email templates for customer email notifications.

## Copy SendGrid API Key to Parcelcraft
1. Sign up for Sendgrid at https://sendgrid.com/
2. Navigate to the [SendGrid API page](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) to see your list of API keys. 
3. If you haven't saved your SendGrid API Key, create a new key and ensure it is a Full Access Key or has access to Design Library, Address Allow List, BCC, Suppressions, Unsubscribe Groups and full access to Email Testing, Mail Send. Copy the API key into a document to make sure you have copied it correctly.
4. Go to the [Parcelcraft Settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/apps/com.productivity.parcelcraft), select the **Notifications** tab and select the **Custom email template with SendGrid** radio button.
