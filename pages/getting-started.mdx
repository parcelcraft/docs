# Quickstart

## Basic setup to create test labels

1. Install Parcelcraft shipping in the [Stripe Apps Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/parcelcraft-shipping).
2. Sign up for a free [EasyPost account](https://www.easypost.com/signup?utm_source=Parcelcraft). EasyPost is our shipping label partner.  Getting your EasyPost API key is completely free.
3. Enter your EasyPost [API Key](https://www.easypost.com/account/settings?tab=api-keys&utm_source=Parcelcraft) into your [Parcelcraft settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.productivity.parcelcraft).
3. Add an origin address in your [Parcelcraft settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.productivity.parcelcraft).


That's it! You've set up Parcelcraft Shipping. You can now print test labels.

## Print real shipping labels

To use Parcelcraft for real shipping labels you'll also need to enter your [billing details](https://www.easypost.com/account/settings?tab=billing&utm_source=Parcelcraft) in your EasyPost account to handle shipping costs.

## Get your own negotiated carrier rates

You can use EasyPost's default carrier accounts or [add your own carrier accounts](https://www.easypost.com/account/settings?tab=carriers&utm_source=Parcelcraft) to get your negotiated rates.

## Yikes! I don't have a Stripe account!

If you don't have a Stripe account yet, setting one up is a simple process:

1. Visit [**Stripe.com**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) to create your account.
2. Follow the prompts to provide your business information and complete the registration process.
3. Once your account is set up, you'll be ready to install and start using Parcelcraft.
