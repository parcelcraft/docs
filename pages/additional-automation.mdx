# Additional Automation

Enhance your shipping workflow with these automation features:

## Digital Scales
Streamline weight input by connecting a [supported digital scale](https://www.printnode.com/en/docs/supported-scales) to [Parcelcraft via PrintNode](/additional-automation/setup-a-digital-scale).

## Custom Email Notifications
Personalize shipping updates for your customers by setting up [custom email notifications](/additional-automation/custom-email-notifications).

## Print to Email
While [setting up print to email](/additional-automation/setup-print-to-email) is possible, we recommend using [PrintNode](/enable-1-click-shipping/setup-printnode-account) for optimal performance and reliability.

Leverage these automation tools to save time and provide a better experience for your customers.
