# Changelog

We regularly make updates to Parcelcraft shipping. This page logs the evolution of the Parcelcraft Shipping app.


---
# 1.3.1  <span style={{fontSize: "16px"}}>May 30, 2025</span>


- Added: We now direct users to an onboarding modal using v9 of the Stripe SDK after initial setup. A link to access the onboarding modal has been added to the settings page.
- Added: An interface to edit default carrier settings was added to the Stripe dashboard shipping rates section at https://dashboard.stripe.com/shipping-rates. We now link to shipping rate or default carrier settings from the unshipped payments and invoices list.
- Added: Payments now display an itemized list of products for shipments, with item weight and quantity used to automatically pre-calculate total shipment weight.
- Added: You can now add custom field data from payment links and checkout sessions to printed shipping labels via the Stripe dashboard payment links section at https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links.
- Added: Users who create shipments from payments can now use 1-click shipment functionality when the payment was created from a payment link or checkout session.
- Added: We now clearly denote shipments with attached Stripe Shipping rates using a link icon and tooltip. We also indicate when default settings are being used to create shipment data. For example, "Ship 2 kilograms via DHL (default)" will display in the unshipped list with a link to update default settings.
- Added: We now warn users who have not established default shipment settings and provide a direct method to configure default carrier settings.
- Fixed: Improved the UX for the page displayed after clicking the "+ Create shipping label" button on the main dashboard view.
- Fixed: In the main settings under origin address, the default address badge was not displayed when appropriate.
- Fixed: Attempting to add funds to a wallet produced unhandled errors.
- Fixed: Attempting to use a digital scale when no scale was properly configured produced no error feedback. We now notify users when a scale connection fails.

# 1.2.0  <span style={{fontSize: "16px"}}>May 12, 2025</span>

- Added: In the shipping history focus view, when resending an email, a loading indicator is now shown.
- Added: A link to refresh the shipment history list is now added to the bottom of the shipment history tab
- Fixed: "Unknown" shipment status text has been changed to "Label created"
- Fixed: If a company name is equal to a name, we only display the name on the shipping label to avoid redundant information on the shipping label.
- Fixed: Resolved a bug introduced in version 1.1.6 that prevented the initial shipment settings from being displayed (Service, packaging, default weight and weight units were not displayed to the user properly when initially creating a shipment)



---
# 1.1.7  <span style={{fontSize: "16px"}}>May 8, 2025</span>

- Added: Print to email now includes packing slips when selected in the Parcelcraft settings.  Packing slips are only supported you create a label from an invoice.


---
# 1.1.6  <span style={{fontSize: "16px"}}>May 2, 2025</span>

- Fixed: A shipment history record was not saved to the database when customer notifications were off.
- Fixed: In some cases, updated shipment settings were not saved between page views.
- Fixed: The customer's EasyPost balance was not displaying correctly in "Manage wallet".
- Fixed: Refreshing the unshipped items list did not work  (There is still a 30-second delay before new items can be searched due to a data freshness issue with the Stripe Search API).
- Added: We now save the customer_id reference when creating a shipment record in our backend in anticipation of future improvements when searching for a customer's shipment history.

---
# 1.1.6  <span style={{fontSize: "16px"}}>April 10, 2025</span>

- Added: When requesting a quote from all carriers, the correct packaging option was not consistently displayed by default. We now automatically set the package type to a custom width x length x height option in this circumstance since this is the only packaging type that is compatible with all carriers.
- Fixed: The code now properly remembers packaging selections per carrier, and if a custom size is requested, we preserve those dimensions between carrier selections. This maintains a consistent user experience when switching between carriers.


---
# 1.1.4  <span style={{fontSize: "16px"}}>March 26, 2025</span>

- Added:  Added support for packing slips.  Packing slips are only supported when printing a shipment from an invoice.  You can modify packing slip settings (including sending packing slips to another print, or turning them on by default in your Parcelcraft print settings.).  You can add a company logo to your packing slip by visiting account.parcelcraft.com.
- Added:  Added a message when settings are saved to tell the user to re-open the app if the app is open in another tab to apply settings. This message appears at the top of the settings page.  
- Fixed:  When viewing an older label, if the image has been deleted from the database, an attempt to display the label would cause the app to crash.  Added a user message if a label image is not available.  We disable printing labels in this case.
- Fixed:  When selecting custom shipment dimensions, the correct interface to enter custom width, length and height would not appear in some cases.
- Fixed:  When requesting a quote the select box with prices would sometimes not fill available space.
- Fixed:  Settings for Printnode would cause an error attempting to enter API key
- Fixed:  Tab key ids are initialized as strings rather than numbers to accommodate future upgrade to SDK v9.
- Fixed:  Added more places where older labels will show the full year in the date, if the label is from a previous year.
