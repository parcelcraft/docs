# Troubleshooting

## I get errors when I create a quote or shipment

Typically the solution to fixing the problem can be found by carefully reading the error message. 
There's a few things you can try to resolve a shipment error:

1. Make sure your address can be verified, if not, turn off Strict auto-verify address


   Click on edit address

    and then Verify Address


   If address verification is not possible turn off strict-verify

2. Try getting a quote from all carriers.  The shipment you are creating may be incompatible with your carrier.

3. If you are shipping internationally, verify you have signed the customs document you have fully declared each item in your shipment.
