# Setting International Shipping Defaults

To enable seamless international shipping with Parcelcraft, follow these steps:

1. **Define Shippable Products**: In the **Shippable products** tab of the [Parcelcraft Settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.productivity.parcelcraft), enter the customs description and tariff code for each product you plan to ship internationally. This information will be used to populate the customs sheet. Incorrect descriptions or tariff codes can cause shipment delays. The US Govornment has a searchable Tariff schedule at https://hts.usitc.gov/

2. **Save Your Tax ID**: Navigate to the **Main settings** tab of the [Parcelcraft Settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.productivity.parcelcraft) page and enter your Tax ID in the designated field. Including your Tax ID on the customs sheet is often required by customs authorities and helps facilitate the clearance process.

3. **Configure Carrier Settings**: Ensure that your chosen shipping carrier supports international shipping and that you have the necessary account credentials set up in the **Carrier defaults** tab of the [Parcelcraft Settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.productivity.parcelcraft).
