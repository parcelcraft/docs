# API Guide

> Note: this article refers how we interact with the Stripe API, for info on getting your EasyPost API key, see [Connect Your EasyPost API key to Parcelcraft](/getting-started/connect-easypost).

Parcelcraft doens't require any software programming skills to use, but for those who have a need to interact with Parcelcraft programmically, we have a variety of ways to interact with your shipment data.  Parcelcraft makes extensive use of the Stripe API and the EasyPost API. 

#### Stripe API

Parcelcraft adds metadata to your PaymentIntenets, Invoices, Shipping Rates and Products to manage shipment status and default options

## Stripe Invoice and PaymentIntents metadata


When an invoice is created, our app automatically will determine if the invoice you've created is for a physical product or for a service.  We use your Stripe Product shippable status, or if you've selected a shipping rate as part of your invoice to indicate via your Stripe metadata if an invoice is shippable.
Our app will automatically add metadata to Stripe invoices prior to shipment.  If an invoice uses a shipping rate or if any product in the invoice is shippable, metadata with a key of "ship_status" and a value of "unshipped" will be added to your invoice metadata.  Invoices that are marked as unshipped will appear in your unshipped invoices list in Parcelcraft.



### Prior to shipment

Supported metatdata prior to shipment


|Metadata key|Possible metadata values  |
|--|--|
| ship_status |**<span className="code">unshipped</span>** The invoice will appear in your unshipped invoices list <br/>**<span className="code">canceled</span>** The invoice will appear in your canceled invoices list  <br/>**<span className="code">shipped</span>** We assume this was shipped or hand delivered outside of the Parcelcraft app <br/>**<span className="code">back_ordered</span>** The invoice will appear in your backordred invoices list <br/>**<span className="code">(no value)</span>** We assume this is a non-shippable invoice or the status has not been determined <br/>|
|is_return  |<span className="code">**true**</span> (as a string) when a shipment is created, the shipment will be created as a return shipment by default |


### After shipment

PaymentIntents and Invoices will mirror each other's metadata values at the time of shipment.  If no invoice exists for a paymentIntent, only the paymentIntent metadata will reflect these values:


|Metadata key| Metadata value example  |
|--|--|
| ship_date | **2024-05-24T18:07:34Z** |
 | ship_status | **shipped** (Could be value of unshipped, canceled, back_ordered.  The ship_status metadata will not exist if invoice or payment is considered to be non-shippable) |
 | shipment_id | **shp_bdf04565433...** The EasyPost shipment ID |
 | tracking_number | **9434600110368044455854** |
 | tracking_URL | **https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction_input?origTrackNum=9434600110368044455854**  |
 | service_name | **USPS Ground Advantage** |
|is_return  | <span className="code">**true**</span> (as a string) the shipment was a **return label** (this metadata key will be absent if the shipment was not a return shipment) |



## Stripe Product metadata

All values are optional, but having product defaults help prepare your shipment according to your product metadata.

|Metadata key| Metadata value example  |
|--|--|
| customs_description | SIM card |
| origin_country | US |
| tariff_code | 8523.52.00 |
| weight | 0.44 |
| weight_unit | Either <span className="code">**gram**</span>, <span className="code">**ounce**</span>, <span className="code">**pound**</span>, or <span className="code">**kilogram**</span>.  Defaults to ounce |
| is_return | <span className="code">**true**</span> Defaults to null or false |


## Stripe Shipping Rate metadata

All values are optional, but having product defaults help prepare your shipment according to your shipping rate metadata, if you use shipping rates in your Stripe Invoices.

|Metadata key| Metadata value example  |
|--|--|
| carrier_id | ca_c38cd24... (Your EasyPost carrier id) |
| package_code | Letter (The package code for your EasyPost carrier. Defaults to <span className="code">**Package**</span>)  | 
| packaging_weight | .26 |
| packaging_weight_unit | Either <span className="code">**gram**</span>, <span className="code">**ounce**</span>, <span className="code">**pound**</span>, or <span className="code">**kilogram**</span>.  Defaults to ounce |
| service_code | FirstClassMailInternational (The compatible service code for your EasyPost carrier) |
