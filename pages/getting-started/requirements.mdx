- A printer
- A scale

## Recommended tools for 1-click shipping

- A digital scale with a USB or serial port 
- A 4x6 inch (102x152mm) [**Thermal label printer**](https://www.amazon.com/4x6-thermal-label-printer/s?k=4x6+thermal+label+printer) that supports printing from a roll of labels

- You must have an origin address set up in the Parcelcraft settings.
- Either use a digital scale or set a default weight for all your products and packaging.
