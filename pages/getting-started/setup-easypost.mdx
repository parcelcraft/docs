#### **How does the EasyPost Wallet work?**

The Wallet enables you to pay for EasyPost shipping labels. Having a sufficiently funded Wallet is critical to prevent any hiccups in your shipping process from failed payments.

You can fund your EasyPost Wallet via ACH bank transfer or Credit Card. After the initial deposit, you can set your Minimum Balance and recharge Amount. Your Wallet will automatically recharge with your set Amount once the balance drops below your Minimum Balance.

For example, let's say you have a Minimum Balance of $500 and a recharge Amount of $1,000. Once your Wallet's balance falls below $500, your Wallet will be recharged with $1,000.

#### **Is it better to pay via ACH or Credit Card?**

- Credit card payments incur a 3.75% processing fee, but fund your account immediately. 
- ACH bank transfers have no processing fee, but you will have to wait a few days before funds transfer to your account.
- You'll need to have funds in your EasyPost account before you can start shipping.

> **We recommend initially funding your account with a credit card to start shipping instantly, and then set up your ACH for long-term savings and stability.**
