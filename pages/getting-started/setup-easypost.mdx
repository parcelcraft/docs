# EasyPost Account Setup

To use Parcelcraft for shipping, you need to integrate it with an EasyPost account. EasyPost provides access to multiple shipping carriers and automates payments to the carriers, streamlining your shipping process. Follow the steps below to set up your EasyPost account and connect it to Parcelcraft.

## Step 1: Create or Log In to Your EasyPost Account

## Step 3: Set Up Your Payment Method

1. Click the **Setup Wallet** button.
   - If you already have a payment method associated with your account, you can click **Add a Secondary Account** or **Add a Primary Account**.
   - Note: You can only have two payment methods added to your account at a time. If you need to add a different payment method, you must first delete one of the existing payment methods using the three-dot button on the right of the payment method.

2. Choose the option to **Add a Bank Account**.
   - Follow the prompts in the secure Plaid-supported portal to log in to your bank account using your online banking credentials.
   - Some banks may require additional authentication (SMS or phone call) using the number on file with your banking institution.
   - Once connected, your bank will be automatically verified, and you can initiate your first transfer of funds (3-5 days processing time once initiated).

## Understanding the EasyPost Wallet

The EasyPost Wallet allows you to pay for shipping labels. It's crucial to keep your Wallet sufficiently funded to prevent any disruptions in your shipping process due to failed payments.

### Funding Your Wallet

You can fund your EasyPost Wallet via two methods:

1. **ACH bank transfer**: No processing fee, but funds may take a few days to become available in your account.
2. **Credit Card**: Immediate funding, but incurs a 3.75% processing fee.

### Setting Up Automatic Recharges

After the initial deposit, you can set your Minimum Balance and Recharge Amount. When your Wallet balance falls below the Minimum Balance, it will automatically be recharged with the specified Recharge Amount.

For example, if you set your Minimum Balance to $500 and your Recharge Amount to $1,000, your Wallet will be topped up with $1,000 whenever the balance drops below $500.

### ACH vs. Credit Card: Which Is Better?

- **Credit Card**: Funds your account immediately, allowing you to start shipping right away. However, it incurs a 3.75% processing fee.
- **ACH bank transfer**: Has no processing fee, making it a cost-effective option for long-term use. However, you'll need to wait a few days for the funds to be available in your account.

> **Tip:** We recommend initially funding your account with a credit card to start shipping instantly. Then, set up ACH for long-term savings and stability.

Remember, you'll need to have sufficient funds in your EasyPost account before you can start generating shipping labels through Parcelcraft.
