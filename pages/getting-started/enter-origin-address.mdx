# Setting Up Your Origin Address

In Parcelcraft, an "Origin Address" represents a location from which your business sends shipments. You must add at least one origin address. If you company has multiple locations, you can create multiple Origin Addresses.

## Adding a New Origin Address

Once you're on the [Parcelcraft Settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.productivity.parcelcraft), follow these steps to add a new origin address:

1. Navigate to the **Main settings** tab if you're not already there.
2. Click on the **+ Add a origin address** button in **Origin Address** section.
3. Fill in the required fields, including the origin address name and address details.
4. After entering all the necessary information, click on the **Verify address** button to confirm the accuracy of the address.
5. If the address is valid, Parcelcraft will save the origin address.

## Editing or Removing a Origin Address

If you need to modify or remove a origin address, you can do so from the same **Main settings** tab:

- To edit a origin address, click on the **Edit** button next to the origin address you want to modify, make the necessary changes, and then click **Verify Address**.
- To remove a origin address, click on the **Remove** button next to the origin address you want to delete.

By setting up your origin address in Parcelcraft, you ensure that your shipping labels accurately reflect the location from which your orders are being shipped. This information is crucial for proper tracking and delivery of your shipments.
