# Setting Up Your Shipment Origin (Warehouse)

In Parcelcraft, a "Warehouse" represents a location from which your business sends shipments. To generate shipping labels with accurate origin information, you need to define at least one warehouse.

## Adding a New Warehouse

Once you're on the Parcelcraft Settings page, follow these steps to add a new warehouse:

1. Navigate to the "Main settings" tab if you're not already there.
2. Locate the "Warehouses" section.
3. Click on the "+ Add a warehouse" button.
4. Fill in the required fields, including the warehouse name and address details.
5. After entering all the necessary information, click on the "Verify address" button to confirm the accuracy of the address.
6. If the address is valid, Parcelcraft will save the warehouse.

## Editing or Removing a Warehouse

If you need to modify or remove a warehouse, you can do so from the same "Main settings" tab:

- To edit a warehouse, click on the "Edit" button next to the warehouse you want to modify, make the necessary changes, and then click "Verify Address".
- To remove a warehouse, click on the "Remove" button next to the warehouse you want to delete.

By setting up your shipment origin (warehouse) in Parcelcraft, you ensure that your shipping labels accurately reflect the location from which your orders are being shipped. This information is crucial for proper tracking and delivery of your shipments.
