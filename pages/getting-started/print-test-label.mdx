## Step 3: Print the Test Label

1. After entering the shipping details, locate the "..." button to the right of the "Buy label" button.
2. Click on the "..." button to reveal additional options.
3. Select "Print test label" from the dropdown menu.

When you click "Print test label," Parcelcraft will generate a test shipping label based on the settings you have configured on the "Printers & digital scale" tab of the Parcelcraft Settings page. By default, the test label will open in a new browser window, allowing you to print it or save it for your records.

> **Tip:** If the test label doesn't open or print as expected, double-check your printer settings and ensure that your printer is connected and functioning properly. You can also review the settings on the "Printers & digital scale" tab to make sure they are configured correctly for your setup.

By successfully printing a test shipping label, you can confirm that your EasyPost integration is working as intended and that you are ready to start processing real shipments through Parcelcraft.
