# Setup PrintNode Account

PrintNode is a cloud printing service that allows you to connect your printers to the internet and manage printing from anywhere. Parcelcraft integrates with PrintNode to enable automatic printing of shipping labels and forms directly to your connected printers. Follow the steps below to set up your PrintNode account.

## Step 1: Create or Log In to Your PrintNode Account

- If you don't have a PrintNode account, [sign up for one here](https://api.printnode.com/app/login/register). The free plan allows up to 50 prints a month.
- If you already have an account, [log in to PrintNode](https://api.printnode.com/app/login).

> **Note:** PrintNode offers a 30-day trial with unlimited printing. After the trial period, you can continue using the free "Lite" plan or upgrade to a paid plan based on your printing needs.

## Step 2: Install PrintNode Client

1. Download and install the PrintNode Client from the [downloads page](https://api.printnode.com/app/downloads).
2. Once installed, the PrintNode Client will run in the background and appear as an icon in your Windows system tray.

## Step 3: Configure PrintNode

2. On the Welcome page, you should see all your local printers automatically listed in the Printer combo box.
