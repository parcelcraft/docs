# Set Shipping Rate Defaults

Open the **Shipping rates** tab on the Parcelcraft Settings page to see the list of shipping methods available. You can add to the list of shipping 

Your shipping forms are prefilled with the defaults you set here, but you can edit a shipment individually when you create a label. Parcelcraft calculates the weight of your shipment based on a formula of (PRODUCT WEIGHT Ã— PRODUCT QUANTITY) + PACKAGING WEIGHT = TOTAL WEIGHT.


TODO - change to match "Carrier defaults"
