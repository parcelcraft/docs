# Define Shippable Products

In the [Parcelcraft Settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.productivity.parcelcraft), navigate to the **Shippable products** tab to view a list of all the products you have defined in Stripe. To ensure a product appears in your unshipped orders list whenever an order is placed, enable the "Shippable" option for that product.

## Automatic Shipment Weight Calculation

If you want Parcelcraft to automatically calculate the shipment weight for your products, follow these steps:

1. Locate the product in the list.
2. Enter the weight of the product in the designated field.
3. Save your changes.

Parcelcraft will now use the provided weight to calculate the total shipment weight for orders containing that product. The formula is (PRODUCT WEIGHT Ã— PRODUCT QUANTITY) + PACKAGING WEIGHT = TOTAL WEIGHT. You will be entering the package weight on the [Shipping rates](/enable-1-click-shipping/set-shipping-rate-defaults) settings page.

## International Shipments

When shipping products internationally, you can streamline the customs process by providing additional information for each shippable product:

1. Enter a description for customs in the designated field. This description will be used on the automatically generated customs sheet for each shipment.
2. Provide the tariff code for the product. The tariff code is essential for determining applicable duties and taxes.

By accurately defining your shippable products and providing the necessary information, you can ensure a smooth and efficient shipping process for both domestic and international orders.
